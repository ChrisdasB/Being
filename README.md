#### Description
For my CS50 final project, i decided to make a small game in Unity. I had some prior experience, but i really struggled on more advanced data types like arrays or lists.
Also a game has to run in realtime, so every operation has to happen within one frame. The biggest challenge, is to react depending on the userinteraction.

I learned:
C# Events,
The principle of a statemachine,
Enums,
How to make your own systems scaleable.

My biggest takeaway:
If oyu want to make a game, you will have a lot of different systems working together.
Instead of just start to code, i learned, that i really should carefully plan out my systems.
I had to refactor a lot of stuff multiple times.

As powerfull as the C# events are, as easy they can cause a lot of problems.

In the future im pretty sure, i will make another game. This type of programming is really satisfying, because you can see the immediate impact on changes.


I enjoyed this course very much.

Thanks to the CS50 team. Your are awesome!
